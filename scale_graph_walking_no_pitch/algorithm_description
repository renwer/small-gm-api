The algorithm implemented here is kind of dumb, but still works fairly well.

In the most basic version, the scale is represented as a graph with every point connected to each other.
The edges of this graph are weighted by the subjective harmony of the interval between them.

Start and end of the sequence are chosen randomly, and all the possible paths within a graph are initialized.
After the solution space is generated, a random path is chosen and from that point a local maximum is reached via the
Hill Climbing algorithm, with a cost function defined as the sum of all edges. This is done to ensure variability while
achieving properly sounding sequences.
